## Config file
### Adding a new manga entry

  To track promotions for your wished manga titles, you can add entries to the `mangas` attribute within your `settings.json` file. Here's how to do it:

  1. Locate the `mangas` Attribute

      Open your `settings.json` file, and within it, you will find the `mangas` attribute.


      ```json

        {
          "mangas": [
            {
              "name": "Manga Title Here",
              "volumeInfo": {
                "max": 99,
                "volumesToIgnore": [
                  "Array of Volumes to Ignore - integers"
                ],
                "volumesToSearch": [
                  "Array of Volumes to Search - integers"
                ]
              }
            }
          ]
        }


      ```

      - Replace "Manga Title Here" with the name of the manga as it appears on Amazon.
      - Set "Maximum Number of Volumes" to the total number of volumes available for this manga.
      - If you want to search for specific volumes, list them in the "Array of Volumes to Search".
      - If there are volumes you want to skip, include them in the "Array of Volumes to Ignore".

      Repeat this process to add as many manga entries as you need to track promotions for different titles. Save the settings.json file after making changes.
      Now, the application will automatically scrape and track promotions for the manga titles you've added to the mangas attribute.üìöüéâ
